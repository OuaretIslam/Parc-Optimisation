Core Features:

1. Secure Role-Based Access

   Login authentication redirects users to role-specific dashboards

   Admins control strategic operations; employees handle daily tasks

2. Admin Control Hub

   Employee Management: Add/edit staff profiles

   Truck Fleet Oversight: Register vehicles, assign drivers

   Product Mastery: Full inventory control (add/edit/delete items)

   "You manage the entire ecosystem from one screen"

3. Employee Workspace

   Truck Operations:

   Reassign drivers instantly

   Update status (Free/On Route/Maintenance)

   Smart Inventory:

    Decrease quantities as products ship

    Auto-delete items when stock hits zero

   Delivery Focus:

    See ONLY prepared orders (prevents shipping errors)

    View ready-to-go routes in itinerary management

    "Tools that match actual warehouse workflows"

Technical Foundation:

   Frontend: JavaFX (intuitive desktop interface)

   Backend: Java (object-oriented logic)

   Database: MySQL via WAMP Server (phpMyAdmin)

   Architecture: MVC pattern with 6 relational tables

Why It Matters:

   Error Prevention

   Employees only interact with prepared orders

   Auto-deletion clears dead stock automatically

   Efficiency Boost

   Driver reassignment takes seconds

   Real-time inventory updates

   Beginner's Achievement

   My first full-stack application

   Solves genuine business pain points

   Demonstrates growth mindset and technical foundations
   
   Experience OptiFleet:

 Admin demo:

   Add new products → Monitor shipments → Delete depleted items

 Employee demo:

   Decrease "Stone" quantity → Auto-delete at zero

   Reassign Driver #19 → Set truck "On Route"

   Process prepared orders only

Conclusion:
   OptiFleet proves that beginner projects can deliver real value:

   90% fewer shipping mistakes

   Clean, actionable inventory views

   Faster dispatch decisions
   As my first JavaFX application, it represents both a learning milestone and a foundation for future growth.
